# Coding Test

Given a set of archives found in the [`archives/`](archives/) directory,
each of which is encrypted using a password from the
[`rockyou_small.txt`](rockyou_small.txt) file, write a Python script to
extract all files from the archives to a new directory and output all lines
containing IPv4 addresses from the extracted files.
